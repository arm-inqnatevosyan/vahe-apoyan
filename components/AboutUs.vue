                    Vahe Apoyan is an artist,  graphic designer and a pedagogue. I have 
                    studied and graduated from Yerevan State Collage of Fine Arts named after Panos Terlemezyan 
                    from 2006 to 2013 /Faculty of Painting/. From 2013 to 2017 I have studied and graduated from 
                    the Yerevan State Academy of Fine Arts /Faculty of Painting/. I got participation in different 
                    republican and solo exhibitions. I had my 3rd solo exhibition just recently at Yerevan Modern 
                    Art Museum, where I presented animated variants of some of my works. Besides artistic 
                    activity, I am also a pedagogue at Nor Norq Youth Center of Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin 
                    and AGBU. Here I teach ceramics. Pedagogical activity is also very interesting and important for 
                    me. It is worth to mention that pedagogical activity is also very binding. I am working with the 
                    children of different ages. Each child has his/her own point of view, outlook. Through their clay 
                    art works, it is possible to discover their inner world, to know their way of thinking. I am sure 
                    that every child needs a special approach, a pedagogical trick or method more appropriate to 
                    his/her outlook and temperament. I think that in this way we can promote their interest in the 
                    relevant activity or subject and stimulate their desire to develop it further.
